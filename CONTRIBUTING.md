## Style

This project is auto-formatted currently by Fourmolu, with settings specified in
[fourmolu.yaml](./fourmolu.yaml). This is subject to change.

This project roughly tries to follow the
[Kowainik Style guide](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide).
Though there are some notable diverges, some of which are listed below.

### Divergences

- Try to limit lines to 100 characters, but no _hard_ limit.
- Let the auto-formatter handle spacing/alignment.
